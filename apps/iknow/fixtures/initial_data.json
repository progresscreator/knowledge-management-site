The information might not be known to anyone (incompleteness) or it might be known to some people but not others (asymmetry). If the asymmetric knowledge exists before a contract or decision, the situation is called adverse selection for the tendency to try to rule out the adverse or poor choices.  If the asymmetric knowledge exists after the contract or decision it is called moral hazard for the tendency of one party to exploit the other.\r\n\r\nThese are the classic areas of information economics.  The more recent studies cover the economics of information goods, markets, and business models.\r\n\r\nInformation goods typically have the property of zero cost reproducibility or nonrivalry (one person's use does not preclude another's).  This means that charging for information can be difficult after the first news has leaked into the market.  Nonrivalry tends to mean there are \"spillover\" benefits to 3rd parties who can use information but need not pay to acquire it.  Further, it means that information is typically under-supplied because the creators often capture very little of information's total value.\r\n\r\nThe economics of inforamation goods also considers \"network effects,\" especially in the case of information standards.

Besides the basics, like not stacking a large amount of records horizontally, and putting the records away after each use, here's some important tips- the paper sleeve that comes with the record can actually damage the vinyl surface, so either replace it with a plastic one or toss it out completely and just use the cardboard jacket. I know that sounds illogical, but the \"loose\" paper can damage the vinyl surface far more than cardboard. Also, a vinyl cleaning solution and a soft cloth used regularly (after every few plays) can help prolong the life of a vinyl record. Making sure that the turntable is properly configured with a lightly balanced arm and a high quality needle. If you pay attention to some of these details, vinyl records can outlive most of us.

This is because, even though it can, as you said, stimulate activity, it can also stimulate high inflation, because if I ask one question worth 1000 points, I will get more \"activity\" than if I ask less expensive questions (of course you wont be able to ask many 1000points questions).\r\nTherefore, the activity should be some function of, wealth balance, points earned, points spent, number of questions asked and number of questions answered.\r\nWhat about the levels (newbie etc...)?
