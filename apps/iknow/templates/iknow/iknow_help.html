				<p>
					iKnow is an information market that allows you to ask questions of the Barter community and reap a profit if your questions become popular. Members of the Barter community answer your questions, and you reward users based on the quality and content of their answer. If you have a specialized question to which you cannot find an answer, try posting it to iKnow and watch the responses roll in! 
				</p>
				<h3 class="people"><a href="">How does it work?</a></h3>
				<p>
					Each time you post, you give the question a reward (Points Offered) and an expiration date by which all answers must be received. Users can find your question via the iKnow homepage and offer advice as long as the question is Active. When the question expires, you can review your received answers and divy up reward funds based on the quality of the responses. You can rate each answer so that users know the quality of their response, and if you find an answer that is really helpful, you can tip that user extra funds.
                <br /><br />
